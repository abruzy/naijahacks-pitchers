# Problem

Inability of doctors to access previous medical records of patients
that have been to other hospitals before and find themselves in another 
location or another hospital or referral.

# Proposed Solution

A platform that can link hospitals together. This will create an interface for pulling 
records of a patient from the hospitals stated to have their records avaailable 
and to enforce more interconnectivity between hospitals such that doctors/physicians 
can be more accountable with how they diagnose and treat their patients.

# Proposed Stack
